This is the fist assignment of CMPUT 301
The first activity page is a welcome page, ou can click on createnewcounter to start the new couner creation or click on history to view and edit the history counter
after you click on the "create a new counter" button, you will go into a new page where you can see an edittext tex waiting fo you to type in the counter name you 
wanna to ceate, Attention!If you type in the same name that you have used bfore for creating a counter,the system will automatically consider that you want to update the counter
has the same name as you type in,so in the following counter page, you can see the counts number is the previous countnumber,and if you made the change to it, the data for the corresponding
counter in the hisory list will also be modified!
now you can click the"create new counter" and get into the counter edit page, you can add the count number,minus the count number o eset the count number to 0,ou can also rename the counter
by type in a name on the editext line and click on rename
now if you get into the history counter view page, you can see a list of histry infomation on the left side of the page line by line,on the right side of the page, the user can click on
"month","day","week"or "hour" button to show the counter that be created or modified within corresponding time period, you can type in the name you want to open-then-edit or remove ,if the name
doesn't exist, the edittext line will show an anouncement to mind you that counter name desn't exists.if the couner list is empty, the text on the top of he page will show"histoy counter list is empty"
